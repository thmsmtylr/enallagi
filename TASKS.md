## [T-001] the [[role]] table, its lock entries, and a resolver that fetches and vendors a role

## [T-013] ponytail-ceiling crates/harness/src/gates.rs:451 marker with no dated kill line naming its text
scope: crates/harness/src/gates.rs, crates/harness/src/skills.rs
blockedBy: none
status: ready
probe: ponytail-ceiling
rows: none — harness
command: `harness probe`
output: |
  PROBE ponytail-ceiling 8
  FINDING ponytail-ceiling crates/harness/src/gates.rs:451 // ponytail: unify with skills::skills_dir (Task 8) once it resolves the same sources.
criteria:
  - one function resolves the skills directory: `gates.rs` no longer carries its own three-source lookup in `skills_dir_for`, and every gates.rs use goes through `skills::skills_dir` (change its signature if the preset lookup belongs inside it; `config::validate` refuses an unknown preset at config.rs:472, so a lookup after `load` cannot miss)
  - the marker at gates.rs:451 is gone and `harness probe` emits no `ponytail-ceiling` line for `crates/harness/src/gates.rs`
  - `cargo test -p harness -q` passes; no file under `crates/harness/tests` changes and no `#[test]` in gates.rs or skills.rs is deleted or weakened (call sites may be updated)
  - `cargo test --workspace -q 2>&1 && cargo clippy --all-targets -q -- -D warnings 2>&1 && cargo fmt --all --check` exits 0
notes: |
  proposed from the output above on 2026-09-08. Not adjudicated.
  2026-09-08 adjudicator: promoted as a lift, not a kill line. The marker's own condition, "once it
  resolves the same sources", holds: `skills::skills_dir` (skills.rs:119-127) reads
  `layout.skills_dir`, then the preset's `skills_dir`, then `<harness_dir>/skills`, the same three
  in the same order as gates.rs:452-463. DECISIONS.md is off scope: nothing to record when the
  shortcut goes.
## [T-014] the templates, roles and skill carry no rationale prose: a comment states a rule or a format, nothing else
scope: templates/*.md, roles/*.md, skills/running-the-loop/**, evals/README.md, adapters/README.md, adapters/bun-turbo/README.md, crates/harness/tests/init.rs, crates/harness/tests/probes.rs
blockedBy: none
status: ready
rows: none — harness
criteria:
  - every HTML comment block (`<!-- … -->`) in `templates/*.md` is at most two lines and states a format or a rule; a sentence explaining why the rule exists is deleted, e.g. `templates/DECISIONS.md:3` "Two things, in this order, because the top of this file is read far more often than the rest." becomes "Rejected findings first, then archived blocks."
  - `grep -nE '\b(because|which is why|the reason|worth|deliberately|on purpose|it turns out|in practice)\b' templates/*.md roles/*.md skills/running-the-loop/SKILL.md skills/running-the-loop/references/task-block.md evals/README.md adapters/README.md adapters/bun-turbo/README.md` prints nothing, except inside the `Why` column of `templates/RAILS.md`, where each cell is at most one sentence and a citation
  - every role prompt keeps every rule, every rail name and every protocol step it has today; only the sentences that justify them go; `wc -l` of each role file is at most 80% of today's count, pasted before and after in notes:
  - `harness probe` on a fresh `harness init` reports the same `rail-unenforced`, `spec-untested`, `queue-hygiene` and `learning-*` counts as before the change (paste both runs in notes:); `cargo test --workspace -q` exits 0 and the tests in scope are updated only where they assert on removed wording
notes: |
  The owner's rule: a comment is short, and exists only to stop a mistake recurring or to explain hard
  code. Rationale belongs in DECISIONS.md, not in the file an agent reads every session.

## [T-015] README.md, docs/intent.md and harness.default.toml describe, and do not argue
scope: README.md, docs/intent.md, crates/harness/harness.default.toml, crates/harness/src/config.rs, crates/harness/tests/cli.rs
blockedBy: none
status: ready
rows: none — harness
criteria:
  - `README.md` is at most 280 lines; every section is a table, a fenced command, or sentences in the present tense that state what a command or field does; `grep -nE '\b(because|which is why|the reason|worth|deliberately|on purpose|we |our )\b' README.md` prints nothing
  - every `_comment`-style key or `#` comment in `crates/harness/harness.default.toml` is at most one line stating what the key is; the cited papers move to `docs/intent.md` under one heading `## References` as a list, one line each, and appear nowhere else; the `include_str!`/migration tests in `config.rs` and `cli.rs` still pass
  - `docs/intent.md` keeps its headings Problem, Proposed outcome, What exists today, Where it goes, Affected users and systems, Constraints, Open questions, References; every bullet under them is a statement or a measurement with its command; the same grep as above over `docs/intent.md` prints nothing
  - `cargo test --workspace -q` exits 0; `harness probe` reports `check-unnamed 0` and `litter 0` after the change (paste in notes:)
notes: |
  Same rule as T-014. Measurements stay; sentences about why a measurement matters go.

## [T-016] the licence is MIT
scope: LICENSE, NOTICE, Cargo.toml, crates/harness/Cargo.toml, README.md, crates/harness/tests/floor.rs
blockedBy: none
status: ready
rows: none — harness
criteria:
  - `LICENSE` is the MIT License text with `Copyright (c) 2026 Thomas Taylor`; `NOTICE` is deleted; `git ls-files NOTICE` prints nothing
  - `crates/harness/Cargo.toml` has `license = "MIT"`; `grep -rn 'Apache' --include='*.md' --include='*.toml' --include='*.rs' --include='*.yml' . | grep -v target/ | grep -v docs/superpowers/` prints nothing
  - `README.md`'s License section reads `MIT. See \`LICENSE\`.`
  - a test in `crates/harness/tests/floor.rs` named `the_licence_is_mit` asserts `LICENSE` starts with `MIT License` and `Cargo.toml` names `MIT`; `cargo test --workspace -q` exits 0
