## [T-008] review-received is declared with gate: none -- nothing fails without it, so relying on it is a hope
scope: crates/harness/harness.default.toml

probe: skill-ungated

command: `harness probe`
output: |
  PROBE skill-ungated 3
  FINDING skill-ungated harness.toml:0 review-received is declared with gate: none -- nothing fails without it, so relying on it is a hope
criteria:
  - the `[[skill]]` entry `id = "review-received"` in crates/harness/harness.default.toml reads `gate = "rejection-repeat"`; its `source`, `path`, `rev` and `why` are unchanged, and no other entry changes
  - `harness probe` emits no `skill-ungated` line naming `review-received` (today: 1)
  - `cargo test -p harness -q --test probes -- every_declared_skill_names_its_enforcing_gate` passes
  - `cargo test --workspace -q 2>&1 && cargo clippy --all-targets -q -- -D warnings 2>&1 && cargo fmt --all --check` exits 0
notes: |
  proposed from the output above on 2026-09-08. Not adjudicated.
  2026-09-08 adjudicator: promoted. Reproduced. `rejection-repeat` (probes/telemetry.rs:135) reports
  the same rejection reason recurring across a task's verdicts, which is what a rejected task that
  did not answer its points looks like from the event log; it is the one probe that fails without
  this skill. The embedded default is the entry the probe reads here; harness.toml is off scope.
  2026-09-08 implementer: one line, harness.default.toml:216 `gate = "none"` → `gate = "rejection-repeat"`;
  `git diff --stat` → 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-). Red before the edit:
  `./target/debug/harness probe` → `PROBE skill-ungated 2` with a FINDING naming review-received;
  after `cargo build -q`: `PROBE skill-ungated 1`, the one left is review-requested (T-009).
  `cargo test -p harness -q --test probes -- every_declared_skill_names_its_enforcing_gate` → 1 passed.
  Reviewer: confirm the diff is that one line and that `rejection-repeat` is a probe name
  (probes/mod.rs:72); the probe must be read from a fresh `cargo build`, not the `harness` symlink.
  Gate: `cargo test --workspace -q 2>&1 && cargo clippy --all-targets -q -- -D warnings 2>&1 && cargo fmt --all --check`
  → exit 0, 308 passed, 3 ignored, 0 failed. Commit: `git add crates/harness/harness.default.toml TASKS.md
  PROGRESS.md && git commit -q -m "feat(config): T-008 review-received names rejection-repeat as its gate"`
  → d1943e2 (amended to carry these lines); `git status --porcelain` → empty.
  2026-09-08 verifier: VERIFIED at cbb7e3b. `git status --porcelain` → empty. `git show --stat HEAD` →
  PROGRESS.md, TASKS.md, harness.default.toml only; `git diff HEAD~1 -- crates/harness/harness.default.toml`
  → one hunk, `-gate = "none"` / `+gate = "rejection-repeat"` at line 216 under `id = "review-received"`;
  source, path, rev, why untouched. `git diff HEAD~1 -- test-hashes.json .check-baseline` → empty;
  .check-baseline has no failure lines. `grep -n '"rejection-repeat"' probes/mod.rs` → 72, 99.
  `touch src/lib.rs && cargo build -q && ./target/debug/harness probe | grep skill-ungated` →
  `PROBE skill-ungated 1`, the FINDING names review-requested (T-009); lines naming review-received: 0.
  `cargo test -p harness -q --test probes -- every_declared_skill_names_its_enforcing_gate` → 1 passed
  (body asserts 7 entries and no "names gate" finding, so an invented gate name fails it).
  `cargo test --workspace -q 2>&1 && cargo clippy --all-targets -q -- -D warnings 2>&1 && cargo fmt --all --check`
  → exit 0; per-binary totals 15+190+21+27+29+4+5+8+9 = 308 passed, 3 ignored, 0 failed. PROGRESS.md
  entry carries `friction: none`. Ponytail: one-line config change, nothing to cut.

## [T-009] review-requested is declared with gate: none -- nothing fails without it, so relying on it is a hope
scope: crates/harness/harness.default.toml
blockedBy: none
status: ready
probe: skill-ungated
rows: none — harness
command: `harness probe`
output: |
  PROBE skill-ungated 3
  FINDING skill-ungated harness.toml:0 review-requested is declared with gate: none -- nothing fails without it, so relying on it is a hope
criteria:
  - the `[[skill]]` entry `id = "review-requested"` in crates/harness/harness.default.toml reads `gate = "verdict-flip"`; its `source`, `path`, `rev` and `why` are unchanged, and no other entry changes
  - `harness probe` emits no `skill-ungated` line naming `review-requested` (today: 1)
  - `cargo test -p harness -q --test probes -- every_declared_skill_names_its_enforcing_gate` passes
  - `cargo test --workspace -q 2>&1 && cargo clippy --all-targets -q -- -D warnings 2>&1 && cargo fmt --all --check` exits 0

  proposed from the output above on 2026-09-08. Not adjudicated.
  2026-09-08 adjudicator: promoted. Reproduced. `verdict-flip` (probes/telemetry.rs:95) reports a
  verdict that flips between passes over the same task, which is what a verifier reading the diff
  for whatever stands out looks like from the event log, and a checklist is what stops it. The
  embedded default is the entry the probe reads here; harness.toml is off scope.

## [T-013] ponytail-ceiling crates/harness/src/gates.rs:451 marker with no dated kill line naming its text
scope: crates/harness/src/gates.rs, crates/harness/src/skills.rs
blockedBy: none
status: ready
probe: ponytail-ceiling
rows: none — harness
command: `harness probe`
output: |
  PROBE ponytail-ceiling 8
  FINDING ponytail-ceiling crates/harness/src/gates.rs:451 // ponytail: unify with skills::skills_dir (Task 8) once it resolves the same sources.
criteria:
  - one function resolves the skills directory: `gates.rs` no longer carries its own three-source lookup in `skills_dir_for`, and every gates.rs use goes through `skills::skills_dir` (change its signature if the preset lookup belongs inside it; `config::validate` refuses an unknown preset at config.rs:472, so a lookup after `load` cannot miss)
  - the marker at gates.rs:451 is gone and `harness probe` emits no `ponytail-ceiling` line for `crates/harness/src/gates.rs`
  - `cargo test -p harness -q` passes; no file under `crates/harness/tests` changes and no `#[test]` in gates.rs or skills.rs is deleted or weakened (call sites may be updated)
  - `cargo test --workspace -q 2>&1 && cargo clippy --all-targets -q -- -D warnings 2>&1 && cargo fmt --all --check` exits 0
notes: |
  proposed from the output above on 2026-09-08. Not adjudicated.
  2026-09-08 adjudicator: promoted as a lift, not a kill line. The marker's own condition, "once it
  resolves the same sources", holds: `skills::skills_dir` (skills.rs:119-127) reads
  `layout.skills_dir`, then the preset's `skills_dir`, then `<harness_dir>/skills`, the same three
  in the same order as gates.rs:452-463. DECISIONS.md is off scope: nothing to record when the
  shortcut goes.
