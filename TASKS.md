## [T-019] queue-hygiene checks the scope of open blocks, not of done ones
scope: crates/harness/src/probes/queue_hygiene.rs, crates/harness/tests/probes.rs, README.md
blockedBy: none
status: review
rows: none — harness
criteria:
  - the scope-matches-a-file check in `crates/harness/src/probes/queue_hygiene.rs` applies to a block at `ready`, `review`, `blocked` or `needs-spec` and is skipped for `done` and for an archived stub; the duplicate-id, missing-status and dangling-`blockedBy` checks stay unchanged for every block
  - a test in `crates/harness/tests/probes.rs`: a queue with a `done` block whose scope names a deleted file yields no finding, and a `ready` block whose scope names a file that does not exist yields one finding naming the pattern
  - the probe's module doc names what it checks and no longer claims the done case
  - `README.md`'s probe table row for `queue-hygiene` matches the new behaviour; no other README change
  - `cargo test --workspace -q 2>&1 && cargo clippy --all-targets -q -- -D warnings 2>&1 && cargo fmt --all --check` exits 0
notes: |
  Measured on enallagi.ai 2026-09-09: fourteen findings, every one a done block whose scoped files a
  later cleanup deleted. A done block's scope is history; an open block whose scope names nothing is
  a task nobody can take, which is the defect worth reporting.

  Implemented: the scope loop's guard is now a four-status allowlist (`ready`, `review`, `blocked`,
  `needs-spec`) at queue_hygiene.rs:54, so `done`, `proposed` and `deferred` all fall through
  untouched; the finding's wording changed from "is done and" to "is open and". The three other
  checks are above the guard and run for every block, unchanged.

  Scrutinise: an archived stub is skipped by the `done` arm rather than by a check of its own —
  archive.rs:174 only ever archives a block that is already `done`, so a stub carrying any other
  status cannot be produced. If you want that belt-and-braces, it is one `common::field(block,
  "archived").is_some()` line.

  Probe on this repo, `./target/debug/harness probe` rebuilt each way:
  before (stashed) `PROBE queue-hygiene 1` + `FINDING queue-hygiene TASKS.md:72 T-016 is done and
  its scope NOTICE matches no file`; after `PROBE queue-hygiene 0`.

  Check: `export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"; cargo test --workspace -q 2>&1 && cargo clippy
  --all-targets -q -- -D warnings 2>&1 && cargo fmt --all --check` → EXIT=0; per-binary
  192+0+10+5+9+16+22+31+28+4+0 = 317 passed, 3 ignored, 0 failed, at 4df3a61 before the commit.
  The new test `a_done_blocks_scope_is_history_and_an_open_blocks_scope_must_name_a_file` was red
  first: it reported `T-002 is done and its scope src/gone.rs matches no file`.

  Commit: `git add crates/harness/src/probes/queue_hygiene.rs crates/harness/tests/probes.rs
  README.md TASKS.md PROGRESS.md` → no output; `git status --porcelain` → `M  PROGRESS.md` /
  `M  README.md` / `M  TASKS.md` / `M  crates/harness/src/probes/queue_hygiene.rs` /
  `M  crates/harness/tests/probes.rs`; `git commit -m "feat(probes): T-019 queue-hygiene checks the
  scope of open blocks, not of done ones"` then `git status --porcelain` → empty. These two
  paragraphs were amended into that commit, so its sha is not quotable from inside it; it is the
  tip of this branch and its subject is the line above.

## [T-020] every iteration leaves exactly one PROGRESS.md entry
scope: crates/harness/src/pipeline.rs, roles/verifier.md, .harness/roles/verifier.md, crates/harness/tests/loop.rs, README.md
blockedBy: none
status: ready
rows: none — harness
criteria:
  - an iteration of the `review` pipeline ends with no `wrote no PROGRESS.md entry` warning in the digest, and `PROGRESS.md` grows by exactly one entry
  - an iteration of the `task` pipeline still grows `PROGRESS.md` by exactly one entry: no duplicate entry from a second role writing one
  - two tests in `crates/harness/tests/loop.rs`, one per pipeline, asserting the entry count and the absence of the warning; count entries by lines matching `^## ` in `PROGRESS.md`
  - whichever mechanism is chosen, state it in one line in `README.md` where the pipelines are described; if a role prompt changes, the source under `roles/` and the installed copy under `.harness/roles/` say the same thing and `harness probe` reports `install-stale 0`
  - `cargo test --workspace -q 2>&1 && cargo clippy --all-targets -q -- -D warnings 2>&1 && cargo fmt --all --check` exits 0
notes: |
  The warning fires on every review-pipeline iteration today, because the verifier writes no entry and
  the launcher expects one. Either the record gains the verdict round's line or the launcher stops
  asking for one; the criteria fix the outcome, not the mechanism.
